Send or not send that is the question

This software determie if an user can send a mail or not
then call the sendmail binairy or return an error.

This is useful with php's sendmail_path

Options :
	-h show help message
        -c initalize the score database (currently bdb)
        -m specify the maximum number of mails an user can send (default 100)
        -F allow to pass a [-f address] sendmail extra command
        -s specify the path to sendmail (default /usr/bin/sendmail)
        -p /path/to/database.db (default /var/db/sendmailornot/spammer.db)
        -b login blacklist given user
        -d login dump the user's score
        -D dump all users score
        -z login zero a single user score
        -Z zero all users score (except blacklisted users)

Build :

Current build system only works on *BSD (see BSDmakefile). 
Autoconf will come soon (or not :)

On other systems you can hand compile :

gcc -O2 -DSENDMAIL=\"/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail\" -DBACKEND_BDB -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib/db48 -ldb -o sendmailornot main.c bdb.c

What you can define is

SENDMAIL	path to the sendmail command you want to use
MAXSPAM		hard coded maximum number of time this binary can be called

For now you must edit the code to change bdb version, sendmail args ...
This will be configurable soon.

Backends :

sendmailornot is designed to use different backends. For now only bdb is implemented.
A backend has his own c file plus a conditional entrie in backends.h and in build system.

You can find in backends.h a description of the backend API (but it should change).
